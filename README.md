# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

For this project, I was given the code for a treasure hunt game where an pirate needed to find treasure. I was given code already for the game, the movement, the reward system, and the experience system. The only thing that I had to code was the Deep Q-learning system itself.

Computer scientists are absolutely critical to the world. They create the tech in cell-phones, computers, airplanes, cars, and literally everything most people use to survive. Without them, humanity as we know it would be utterly lost. And with them, we can plan and build a better future with more electronics, solving problems that the general public never even knew existed.

I apporach a problem as a computer scientist step-by-step and by checking for errors along the way. All code is made up of incremental changes and iterations. By understanding the problem through simple means and solving it simply (even if there are lots of lines of code that seem complex), then you have solved a problem as a computer scientist.

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and to the organzation I work for is ensuring that my code does not contain any sort of bias that can be used against anyone (at least in the AI world). By ensuring that my code does what it is meant to do without discriminating in one way or another, I have done my job with my AI. In the case that there are no humans directly involved, then it is critical that whatever code that I am coding is able to be read easily and easily manipulated. By doing this, I would allow the company to make changes in the future in the case that someone needs their data deleted, there was a data breach, or many other things.
